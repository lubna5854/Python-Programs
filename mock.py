Coding Interview Round :

Given a string str and an integer K, the task is to reduce the string by applying the following operation any number of times until it is no longer possible:
Choose a group of K consecutive identical characters and remove them from the string.
Finally, print the reduced string.

Example :

Input: K = 2, str = “accksforaooks”
Output: aksforaks
Explanation: After removal of both occurrences of the substring “cc” and “oo”, the string reduces to “aksforaks”.
Input: K = 3, str = “qddxxxd”
Output: q
Explanation:
Removal of “xxx” modifies the string to “qddd”
Again, removal of “ddd” modifies the string to “q”
